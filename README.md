Welcome to YourMet, a full-stack project with a responsive design created using the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art's public API.

In YourMet, you can create your own personal art galleries with artworks that are currently in the Met.<br />

Additionally, you can:

<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>mark artworks as "seen" if you have physically seen them while visiting the Met <br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>share your gallery with friends (or share your friends' galleries with others) <br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>customize your account <br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>access the website from your mobile devices

Users are authenticated through Auth0 with integrated Google sign-in.
Your gallery is saved through a PostgreSQL database. <br />
